### **Concept 2: Control Flow (If-Else & Switch Case)**

#### **1. Deep Explanation (The Logic)**

By default, code runs linearly: line 1, then line 2, then line 3.
**Control Flow** allows the program to make decisions and "branch" into different paths based on the current situation.

There are two main tools for this:

1.  **If / Else:** Checks a **Boolean Condition** (True or False). It is used for complex logic, ranges, or multiple variables.
      * *Logic:* "Is the distance less than 5? If yes, stop."
2.  **Switch Case:** Checks a **Discrete Value** (Equality). It compares a single variable against a list of specific "labels" (Cases).
      * *Logic:* "What is the current gear? Is it 1, 2, or R?"

#### **2. Why do we use it?**

  * **Reactivity:** A robot without control flow is just a scripted machine. Control flow allows the robot to react to sensors (e.g., "If obstacle detected, turn left").
  * **State Management:** Robots often have states (Idle, Docking, Charging). `Switch` cases are the standard way to organize these distinct behaviors.

-----

#### **3. Syntax & Rules**

**A. If / Else If / Else**
Used when conditions are ranges (`<`, `>`) or complex logic (`&&`, `||`).

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Runs if true
} else if (other_condition) {
    // Runs if first is false AND this is true
} else {
    // Runs if everything else is false
}
```

**B. Switch Case**
Used when checking a single integer or character against specific values.

  * **Limitation:** You cannot use `switch` with Strings or Ranges (you can't say `case > 10`).
  * **The `break` Keyword:** Crucial. It tells the code to stop and exit the switch block. Without it, the code "falls through" to the next case automatically.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
switch (variable) {
    case 1:
        // Code for 1
        break; // Exit
    case 2:
        // Code for 2
        break;
    default:
        // Runs if no case matches (like 'else')
        break;
}
```

-----

#### **4. The Trap: "The Forgotten Break"**

In a `switch` statement, if you forget to write `break;`, the computer does not stop. It continues executing the code for the **next case** as well.

  * **Scenario:** You have Case A (Turn Left) and Case B (Drive Forward).
  * **Bug:** You trigger Case A but forget `break`.
  * **Result:** The robot turns left **AND** immediately drives forward, potentially hitting the wall it was trying to avoid.

#### **5. Code Example**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int robot_mode = 2;       // 1=Idle, 2=Auto, 3=Manual
    double battery_level = 15.5;

    // --- Part 1: Switch (State Management) ---
    // We check a specific integer value
    switch (robot_mode) {
        case 1:
            std::cout << "State: IDLE. Waiting..." << std::endl;
            break;

        case 2:
            std::cout << "State: AUTONOMOUS DRIVING." << std::endl;
            
            // --- Part 2: If-Else (Logic Check inside a case) ---
            // We check a range/condition
            if (battery_level < 20.0) {
                std::cout << "WARNING: Low Battery! Returning to dock." << std::endl;
            } else {
                std::cout << "Battery OK. Continuing mission." << std::endl;
            }
            break; // Don't forget this!

        case 3:
            std::cout << "State: MANUAL CONTROL." << std::endl;
            break;

        default:
            std::cout << "ERROR: Unknown Mode ID!" << std::endl;
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **6. ROS2 Context: "State Machines & Callbacks"**

  * **Lifecycle Management:** ROS2 nodes have a specific "Lifecycle" (Unconfigured, Inactive, Active, Finalized). Developers use **Switch Cases** extensively to handle what the node should do in each state.
  * **Subscriber Logic:** Inside a callback function (when data arrives), you use **If-Else** to filter bad data.
      * *Example:* "If the Lidar gives a value of `inf` (infinity), ignore it. Else, process it."

#### **7. Task: The "Robot Gearbox"**

**Scenario:**
You are writing the transmission logic for a rover.
The rover has a variable `char gear` and a variable `double speed`.

**Requirements:**

1.  Define `char gear = 'D';` (Options: 'P' for Park, 'D' for Drive, 'R' for Reverse).
2.  Define `double speed = 0.0;`
3.  **The Logic Puzzle:**
      * Use a **Switch Statement** to check the `gear`.
      * **Case 'P':** Set `speed` to 0. Print "Parking".
      * **Case 'D':** Set `speed` to 10. Print "Driving Forward".
      * **Case 'R':** Set `speed` to -5. Print "Reversing".
      * **Default:** Set `speed` to 0. Print "Error: Unknown Gear".
4.  **The Trap:**
      * Intentionally remove the `break;` statement inside **Case 'D'**.
      * Run the code with `gear = 'D'`.
      * **Observation:** The output will likely say "Driving Forward" AND "Reversing", and the final speed will be -5 (Reverse) instead of 10. This shows why `break` is critical.
5.  **Fix:** Put the `break` back and confirm the speed is 10.
